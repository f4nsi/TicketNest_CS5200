# TicketNest:Database System Management Course Project

## 1. Executive Summary
**TicketNest** is a comprehensive ticketing system simulating TicketMaster, designed for users, event organizers, and administrators to manage and interact with events, ticketing operations, and each other. **Users** can manage their preferences, purchase tickets, attend events, and submit reviews. **Event organizers** can create and manage events, configure various ticket types, and oversee ticket availability. **Administrators** handle customer service, including refunds, and analyze user activities and sales performance to optimize the platformâ€™s operations. To facilitate these processes, the system includes essential entities such as **User**, **Event**, **Ticket**, **TicketType**, **Order**, **Preference**, **Reviews**, and **PaymentMethod**. This project allows for efficient event management, smooth ticket sales, and personalized user experiences.

## 2. Responsibilities
- In this project, my primary responsibilities included:
  - **Database Management**: Developed and maintained the database schema in MySQL and MongoDB with other teammates.
  - **SQL Query Optimization**: Designed and implemented SQL Query to generate event performance reports, calculating total tickets sold, revenue, and average ratings for a specified date range. Exported these reports as CSV files for detailed analysis.
  - **Front-end Development**: Created prototypes for user and administrator features with Budibase.
  - **Testing and Debugging**: Conducted thorough testing for all the user and administrator features, identified bugs, and resolved issues to ensure application stability and usability.
- My teammates included:
  - Yinuo Feng
  - Meihao Cheng
  - Jieling Gong

## 3. Budibase Deployed Link  
Budibase is a low-code platform that allows users to take control of the multiple datasets and rogue spreadsheets. In this project, we use Budibase to streamline the creation of a responsive and user-friendly interface. By integrating with both MySQL and MongoDB, Budibase facilitated seamless data management and dynamic interactions between relational and NoSQL databases. It allowed for rapid prototyping of user dashboards, event management pages, and administrative tools, while enabling efficient CRUD operations through pre-configured workflows.

    BEGIN
        TRUNCATE TABLE Report;
    
        INSERT INTO Report (event_id, event_name, ticket_sold, revenue, avg_rating, event_date)
        SELECT e.event_id,
               e.event_name,
               CASE 
                   WHEN e.event_status = 'Canceled' THEN 0 
                   ELSE COALESCE(ticket_data.total_tickets_sold, 0) 
               END AS ticket_sold,
               CASE 
                   WHEN e.event_status = 'Canceled' THEN 0 
                   ELSE COALESCE(ticket_data.total_revenue, 0) 
               END AS revenue,
               COALESCE(AVG(r.rating), 0) AS avg_rating,
               e.date AS event_date
        FROM Event e
        LEFT JOIN (
            SELECT t.event_id,
                   SUM(ot.quantity_purchase) AS total_tickets_sold,
                   SUM(t.price * ot.quantity_purchase) AS total_revenue
